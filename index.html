    <p>The Suffragettes of Sheffield will be commemorated with a plaque outside a hidden high-street shop next month, after a temporary one was unveiled this week.</p>

    <p>A crowd of around 50 people were outside the shop on Chapel Walk on Tuesday as Lord Mayor Anne Murphy gave a speech on the centenary of women’s suffrage.</p>

    <p>The Labour councillor put up the provisional plaque and spoke about the importance of those she called ‘our sisters’ in helping to gain equality.</p>

    <p>Chrissy Meleady MBE, who is the chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission UK, said: “The plaque is absolutely vital because of Sheffield’s position in these movements.</p>

    <p>“This was the first place where the suffragettes came together and it hasn’t been given much recognition.”</p>

    <p>The opening on Tuesday was the 100th anniversary of the Representation of the People Act 1918- where women gained the right to vote for the first time.</p>

    <p>Nikki Bond, Sheffield Central Labour Party’s Women’s Officer, set up a crowdfunding page to raise money for the plaque.</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://"> "It's about being invested in Sheffield."</blockquote>

    <p>She said that only last Monday the lord mayor told her they were struggling to pay for the plaque.</p>

    <p>She decided to raise the money herself and reached £700 in five days, after two donations of over £100.</p>

    <p>She said the plaque will give people a sense of ownership over a part of Sheffield’s history that they can then come and see.</p>

    <p>She said: “It’s about people being invested in Sheffield’s history and in something which is so important for women in Sheffield as well.</p>

    <p>“We have such a proud history of strong Sheffield women, including the statue to the women of steel.”</p>

    <p>She added: “The history shows itself in Sheffield’s leading women today. The lord mayor is a woman, so is the leader of the council, and the deputy leader is a woman.”</p>

    <p>A permanent plaque is expected to be ready for international women’s day on 5 March and a local democracy day for women is being organised to follow.</p>

    <p>Children doing research in 2010 found the unoccupied shop, most recently used by the sweet company CandyCo, was the Sheffield headquarters for the Suffragettes in 1908.</p>

    <p>The shop was a centre for the Women’s Social and Political Union and sold memorabilia to support the cause.</p>

    <p>It doubled as the WSPU office and it was one of the first in the country.</p>

    <p>Ms Meleady said: “Shop owners mixed with the suffragettes and the cooperative women’s guild- who also held meetings there- and fought for universal emancipation.”</p>

    <blockquote cite="http://"> "The plaque is absolutely vital."</blockquote>

    <p>The WSPU was led by Adela Pankhurst after she was sent by her mother Emmeline to organise the movement in Sheffield.</p>

    <p>Emmeline formed the group in 1903 to campaign for women’s right to vote and she played a central role.</p>

    <p>Adela lived at 45 Marlborough Road, Broomhill, and applied a more militant form of protest.</p>

    <p>She led a demonstration of over 800 unemployed women through the city centre in 1908 and secretly tried to gain access to the Cutler’s Feast- by disguising herself as a kitchen maid.</p>

    <p>She was discovered so gave a speech outside the Town Hall about the injustices facing women in society.</p>

        <p>Jill Liddington, an expert in women’s history at the University of Leeds and author of One Hand Tied Behind Us, said: “I think it would be an excellent idea to have a plaque.”</p>

        <p>Millicent Fawcett, founder of the NUWSS, one of the largest suffrage groups, was commemorated with a plaque in Cambridge on Tuesday.</p>
